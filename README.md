## Motivation

Many people who aspire to get into the software industry in Montenegro, such as students (who are finishing up their studies) and people who are switching their job positions are asking me which is the best company and/or where to start their careers? I can't tell you which company is the best because this is a subjective matter. However, I decided to create a list of well-known software companies in Montenegro. Hopefully, you will find this list interesting and helpful!
